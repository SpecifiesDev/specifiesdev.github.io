                            Hello, this page is designed to provide detailed instructions on accessing beta deployments of an application known as JC-Frontend through Expo. This way of going about it is necessary as the application has yet to be finalized and published on the app store, and this way provides the Developers with a method of placing the application directly in the hands of the people providing feedback.
                        </p>

                        <p class = "center-text body-text">
                            The first thing you're going to want to do is install the application "Expo" on your mobile device. If you own an iPhone you can download it <a class = "local" href = "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779" target = "__blank">here</a>. If you own an Android, you may download it <a class = "local" href = "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US" target = "__blank">here</a>. Expo is just an approved application that processes our javascript bundles to display the built UI. What you see load on Expo, is what is intended to load once the application is bundled into its native form.
                        </p>

                        <p class = "center-text body-text">
                            Once your application has downloaded, proceed to open it. If you are one of the members with access to this project you were provided with account details to the account that has access to the deployment. When prompted to login, login with these details. This is beyond important, as without being logged in you will <b>NOT</b> have access to the deployment.
                        </p>

                        <p class = "center-text body-text">
                            When you login Expo should land you on the "Profile" tab. If this is not the case, just tap on the tab in the bottom navigator. On the profile tab, for our beta account, you should see a published project "JC Frontend" with a slug of "frontend." Here's a visual example:
                        </p>

                        <img src = "./assets/images/example1.jpg" class = "page-images">

                        <p class = "center-text body-text">
                            Now, tap on the JC frontend project. The bundled application will download, and load on your phone. What is displayed, is the exact app as is written. The Developers of the backend have been informed that they should republish the project everytime the version is incremented. If you don't see the screen that is (or is similar to the one) below, please contact me.
