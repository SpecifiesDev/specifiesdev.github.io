                            Hello, this page is primarily designed to inform you on how Amazon Web Services functions. Throughout the rest of this document I will short hand Amazon Web Services to AWS. AWS is a platform that has a lot of useful services - but for our web application we're going to use an EC2 instance. An EC2 instance is essentially a machine sitting in a server box that we can install our server software on, and open ports up. This document will attempt to provide you with apt documentation on how to set up a root account, provide the developers with access to push the server, and ensure that you're well informed on how the payment process for AWS functions.
                        </p>

                        <p class = "center-text body-text">
                            Firstly, let me explain how payment works with AWS. AWS heavily supports a "pay as you use" plan, meaning instead of paying a set rate you pay for the amount of requests that hit your server. When you go to create your account you will see that there is an option for free EC2 instances for a year - and this is what we will attempt to use. The way this free service works, is that as long as the server isn't stressed above a certain threshold, it's free for a year. Once the threshold is exceeded, you pay for whatever is used at normal rate until the next billing cycle. Let me stress that the chances of us needing to upgrade are signifcantly low, because the layers of the application make very basic data requests to retrieve organizations and posts. I will be sure to monitor the data and notify you if anything needs to be changed.
                        </p>

                        <p class = "center-text body-text">
                            Now, let me explain what a root account is. A root account is the account that owns the services, and thus manages payments. This is what you will be creating. If you click <a href = "https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%2Fconsole%2Fhome%3Fstate%3DhashArgs%2523%26isauthcode%3Dtrue&client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A015428540659%3Auser%2Fhomepage&forceMobileApp=0" class = "local" target = "__blank">here</a> you will be redirected to the account creation page. Most of this is done off of memory as I already have a root account with another company, but you should be taken through a normal account creation process. It should also ask you for billing details, and explain the payment process. You will also have to go through the typical email verification process. Once this is complete, it could take up to 24 hours for Amazon to approve you account for us to move forward. Once this is complete, you may refer to the next step.
                        </p>

                            When you first created your account, if you recall there were two account types. Here is where the "IAM user" account comes into play. IAM is short for Identity and Access Management. This is how the Developers will create, access, and manage the necessary resources to run the backend. You may ask why we choose to go this route, and the answer is simple: security. IAM administration groups first and foremost isolate the root account from users managing resources, protecting your personal details. Secondly, the allow you to track who does what, in the event of a security breach.
