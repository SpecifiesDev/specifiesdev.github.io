                            Did Gatsby achieve the American dream?
                        </h6>

                            Ultimately, Gatsby did achieve the reality of what is perceived as the American dream. He was born to a 
                            dirt poor farming family, and rose to be one of the most promiment rich people in New York. That's the 
                            concept of the American dream. While it collapsed around him due to a series of unfortunate events, Gatsby
                            did what so many could not and achieved the American dream.

                            What did Daisy love? Gatsby, money, or herself?
                        </h5>

                        <p class = "center-text body-text answer-text">
                            I think Daisy truly loved Gatsby. Many examples can be found throughout the novel. For example, the first
                            luncheon with Daisy and her husband Tom, Nick Carraway happens to mention Gatsby and Daisy's immediate response 
                            is one that draws her complete attention. Most women wouldn't do this to someone they had relations with five years
                            prior. The counter-argument would be that maybe she was gasping because she knew of his money, and Tom was a terrible
                            husband. This wouldn't work, because when Daisy met him, he was an attending officer to one of her family's parties.
                            She was aware that he didn't come from money.
                        </p>

                            What made Gatsby's dream corrupt?

                            His love for Daisy. His love for Daisy led to him making questionable choices in business practice,
                            associating him with terrible people like Wolfsheim. He didn't climb the ladder in a legitimate sense.

                            Right, I've never been good with landing pages, especially when they're personal projects.
                            This website was built as a project for a high school English class. Most of it is 
                            self explanatory. All resources on this page apart from the rotating profile pictures were created
                            using After Effects & Photoshop. On the off chance that you're here for a portfolio, click the github
                            icon located in the footer element. I made it fairly responsive, but wasn't terribly concerned about it
                            due to the fact that no one should be using this on a mobile device.
