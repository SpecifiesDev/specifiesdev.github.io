                        The Valley of Ashes is an extremely polluted, impoverished, and nearly destroyed piece of land between an area known as West Egg and New York City.
                        In <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, the author describes the Valley with this quote: "a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills 
                        and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of house and chimneys...."
                        This quote helps explain the true nature of the valley, and where its people are at in life. Many people describe the 1920's as a period of time 
                        where everyone was able to make it well - but this was not the case. This setting helps describe conditions created by people who are just trying 
                        to survive. They're not focused on social standing, or natural health. They just want to survive. The valley helps point to the fact that the rich 
                        got wealthy off of the poor, who were subsequently trying to survive.

                      The attraction that I have created is very simple. It will be a sloped "mountain" with a platform on the bottom 
                      and a platform on the top. The bottom will contain 6 pads, the top 2. These number choices are chosen due to the 
                      wealth divide, with the wealthy being a smaller portion of the population. The goal is rather simple for both parties.
                      The poor are trying to force their pad up by making financial choices while the wealthy are trying to force them back 
                      down to the bottom through backdoor deals, etcetera. The attraction rotation time will last six minutes. If a poor reaches the top,
                      his / her goal is to supress his former poor bretheren. This is satire on the fact that when many people gain wealth, they forget
                      where they came from. The game is specifically designed to give the wealthy the advantage, hence the attraction name "<em>A Place For The Hopeless</em>." 
                      Whichever team scores the most points through their choices, will win tickets.

                      The attraction I created aptly reflects the underlying wealth divide that is typically trifled by the crash of 1929 and why it occured.
                      It displays how the poor people are usually born poor and die poor, trumping the idea of a true American dream. That was the author's
                      purpose of including the valley of ashes between East & West egg. Valleys are usually between <em>mountains</em>, and in this case The 
                      Valley of Ashes is stuck between mountains of wealth and power that they can not climb out of easily. Throughout American history
                      the poor are typically forgotten by the idea of an American dream, and this helps bring light to this fact.
