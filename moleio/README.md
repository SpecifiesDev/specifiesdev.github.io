# Mole Project
This is the source code for the game I decided to create for my mole project.

The main source can be found in game.js, while the level mapping source can be found in levels.js. You may also navigate the resources I used to create the tiles. As of this commit, everything apart from death mechanics and full level maps is finished. DM and FLMs will only take 50-100 lines of code, depending on how I decided to go about it. The hardest part about this entire thing was the fact that my stupid self decided to hand-code physics, or at least try. Because of that this program is pretty much broken in terms of a game, but works neverthless.
